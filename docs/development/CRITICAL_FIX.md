# ✅ CRITICAL FIX APPLIED

## Issue Found
Tailwind CSS was not loading - the page showed unstyled HTML.

## Root Cause
1. Missing `postcss.config.mjs` file
2. Missing Tailwind v4 theme configuration in `globals.css`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Created postcss.config.mjs
```javascript
const config = {
  plugins: {
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": {},
  },
};

export default config;
```

### 2. Added Tailwind v4 Theme to globals.css
Added `@theme` block with all color definitions (teal and slate colors).

## How to Start

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000**

The site should now show:
- ✅ Dark theme (slate-950 background)
- ✅ Teal accent colors
- ✅ Proper typography
- ✅ All animations
- ✅ Styled components

## Verification

If the site still looks broken:
1. Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
2. Clear the cache: `rm -rf .next`
3. Restart: `npm run dev`

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Ready to test!
